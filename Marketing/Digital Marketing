                    Section: 2 - Marketing Fundamentals
1 - Project: Create a Buyer Persona & Unique Selling Proposition
A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing 
customers.
Unique selling proposition - This defines your position in the marketplace and lets you stand apart from competitors.
There is a template available for download which you will fill in with data concerning your own business

2 - How to Create a Buyer Persona
This is the person you are creating your content, products or service for. They can’t wait for you to launch because you solve a 
problem they have!
Instead of focusing “target market” or something abstract., you humanise your marketing and make it real.
Developing a buyer persona results in stronger and more cost effective marketing.
It allows you to convey a more tailored message, minimise advertising waste and discover objections holding back customers.

Are there any tricks to developing a buyer persona? - Yes! Just look in the mirror.
If you have an idea for a business, more than likely it came from a frustrating experience you had. A problem you needed fixing. 
A solution that didn’t get the results or was just too hard to implement.
You may also have observed a pain point of someone you have close contact with.
It’s unlikely your buyer persona is someone you’ve never met before. How could you understand intimately what’s holding them back 
from achieving their goal?
