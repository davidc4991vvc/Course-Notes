How you can have a remarkable, amazing SEO strategy in 2017. 
Understanding some of those big-picture search trends. What are the search engines doing? 
How is that affecting my strategy? How does that mean I should influence and affect my specific tactics for 2017? 

1 - Understand the big-picture search trends
A huge rise in SERP features, meaning that Google is showing many more types of data and types of markup in the search results. 
A rise in instant answers. This is especially true on mobile, but it's true on desktop as well. Google is trying to answer a lot of 
the queries themselves and that can mean they're taking away traffic from a client
Intent > keywords: We're also seeing this trend that started with Hummingbird and now, obviously, continued with RankBrain around intent,
searcher intent being more important than keywords in how we target our content. This does not mean you can remove keywords from the 
equation. You have to understand what the searcher has typed into the engine before you can serve their intent, and very small 
variations in keyword structure can mean real changes in searcher intent.
The value of comprehensiveness has clearly been on the rise and it definitely is a trend that is expected to continue into 2017. 
Multi-device speed and user experience,Google has taken action against overlays and pop-ups. They've taken action, clearly, 
that suggests that there are some engagement metrics that are going on there, and that sites that have better user experience and 
that garner better engagement are doing better in the search results.
There are trends around unreliability of Google data. That includes search volume data. It includes data in AdWords, around Google 
showing you which keywords are in there. It includes inaccuracies in Google Search Console, formerly Webmaster Tools, around rankings. 
if Google says you got this many impressions and this many clicks, that may be wrong and false, so be cautious.
Voice search, clearly on the rise. Not yet a huge trend in terms of an market that search marketers can go after, but SEO should
think about voice search impacting your results in the future and what types of content you might want to be ahead.
Machine learning and deep learning, Google has clearly made a shift to that in the last 18 months, it affect the search results in 
terms of how they're considering links, how they're looking at keyword searches, and how they're looking at content.
Multi-visit buyer journeys have always been important and a lot of sites are optimizing for it, which means that the competitive 
that you don't just consider a single visit in your conversion path or in your optimization path, and that means, for SEOs, considering 
what are all the queries someone might perform as they come to and come back to my site.
Bias to brands, that is a continuing trend over the last few years. We're still seeing it, and we're seeing it even more so. I would 
say we're seeing it even when those brands have not necessarily earned tons of links, which used to be the big dominating factor in 
the world of is a brand stronger than a non-brand. A lot of times that was about links. Now it seems that those are decoupled.
That being said, we're kind of feeling an undiminished value of links. If you've built a brand, if you've done a lot of these things 
successfully, links are certainly how you can stand out in the search results. That's pretty much as true in 2016 and '17 as it was 
in 2011 and 2012. Only caveat there is that the quality of links matters a lot more.

2 - Map your organizations top-level goals to how your SEO efforts can best assist:
Step two is to map your organization's top-level goals to your SEO tactics, and that can look something like this.
Here's Zow Corporate, the opposite of Moz, which is hopefully not very corporate. Zow Corporate's big three for 2017, they want to 
grow revenue with new enterprise customers, they want to lower their costs to get more profitable, and they want to improve their 
upsell to existing customers. So SEO can help with these things by — and this is a really smart framework — you want to take the 
things that your organization wants to accomplish at its executive or board level, and you want to show that SEO is actually doing 
those things, not just that you're trying to rank for keywords or bring more traffic, but that you've mapped your priorities in this 
way.

3 - Build a keyword-to-content map
The basic concept is to have a list of terms and phrases that come out of your tactics and your goals, that you build a map for 
and then show like, "All right, here's how we're ranking today. Here's the URL which we're ranking with," or, "We don't yet have a URL 
that's targeting this keyword phrase, and thus, we need to build it," and then the action required there and what the priority is.

4 - Break down the SEO efforts into discrete projects with ETAs and people assigned, ordered by expected ROI
You can also think about adding some additional things to your content-to-keyword map or to your project list by breaking down all 
the SEO efforts that you're going to do to hit all these goals into discrete projects with a few things — an estimated time of delivery,
the people who are assigned to it, and an ordering based on the expected return on investment.

5 - Build a reporting/measurement system that shows progress and ties revenue/goals to clear metrics:
Step five - Build a reporting and measurement system that's going to show progress, not just internally but to the entire team, 
or to your client so that they can see progress this gives a real picture of how SEO efforts map up to these big-picture goals. 
It's a great way to frame SEO campaigns.
