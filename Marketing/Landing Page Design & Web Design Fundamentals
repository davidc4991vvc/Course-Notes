Preview of the course
CRO - Conversion Rate Optimisation
Spending on traffic acquisition was bigger than traffic optimisation by 92%
All landing pages have issues which affect potential customers
Clarity - is the most important element in landing page design
5 second usability test - The most famous of usability tests, cheap and easy to run, the test is run by showing
an image of your landing page with branding removed to people for 5 seconds. They are then asked some questions 
often including
  Who is the company
  What do they sell
  What value do they add to you etc
  

3 - The Myth Of The Perfect Landing Page Conversion Rate
There is no such thing as a perfect conversion rate
Not all site visitors are sales prospects
There is no such thing as an average conversion rate either
Conversion ceiling is well below 100%
3 types of visitors
  No's - Will never convert due to factors like affordability etc
  Yes's - Will always convert due to high level of commitment
  Maybe's - This section of visitors has the highest potential influence


4 - The 3 Main Types of Landing Pages and How To Use Them Effectively
The goal of the marketing campaign will determine what is the correct type of landing page.
Primary Site
  - Contains everything about your business
  - Provides most information
Microsite
  - A modified version of main site
  - Strong emphasis on one type of conversion action
  - Some are used as to uplift businesses
Dedicated Landing Page
  - No navigation
  - Few links
  - Always contains a call to action
  - Has a sense of immediacy
  - Most popular among PPC\SEO campaigns targeting high commercial keywords 
Attention Ratio 
  - Have as few distractions as possible away from primary conversion action
  - ideal ratio is 1 - 1 and dedicated landing page offers that opportunity
  - The closer to 1-1 ratio then the higher conversion rates will be


5 - Common Business Models and Understanding Your Conversion Actions
A conversion is defined as an action that is measurable and has a value
Ecommerce 
          - Most popular conversion is a sale
          - Requires high commitment
          - Average 1-3% average for ecommerce sites
Lead Gen 
          - Usually a service
          - More higher end good
          - Less commitment than ecommerce
          - Longer sales cycle
Publishers\Blogs
          - Make money from ad revenue
          - Give away content
          - Increased prevalence of premium offers
          - Conversion actions include newsletter signup, time on site, click on ads

Desired Conversion Actions 
  - Sales, Subscriptons, Form Fill Rate, Downloads, Advert Revenue

Ad Revenue has decreased over the last few years

Most websites value multiple actions
Every page should have only one primary conversion action
Good design has one conversion in mind


6 - The AIDA Sales Funnel and The Online Decision Making Process
First introduced 1898 Elias StElmo Lewis
The AIDA sales funnel is the foundation of most modern sales teams
All buyers go through 4 cognitive phases
Awareness - Become aware of a need and the existence of a product or service which can meet that need
Interest - Interested in learning about the product or service 
Desire - An active sense of desire for that particular product or service
Action - Where the buyer takes the action

Prospect need different information and treatment in different parts of the funnel
Length of cycle(time take to go through the funnel) can vary greatly
The AIDA funnel is more complex today but still essential

Browsers = Awareness
Evaluators = Interest
Transactors = Desire
Customers = Action
