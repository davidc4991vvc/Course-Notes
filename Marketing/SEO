                    Section 9: Follow and Nofollow links
1 - Follow and Nofollow links 
Follow links are links that count as points, pushing SEO link juice and boosting the page rank of the linked-to sites, 
helping them go higher in the SERPs as a result. One example is the click here for more information which will take you to
the information
In contrast nofollow is used by Google, to specify that the Google search spider should not follow that link. This means that you
will get no benefit from links to your site SEO wise
Ensure that your link policy uses follow links to gain the benefit from high quality links.

2 - Page Level No Follow 
No follow can be done at a page level
Nofollow can be put in the meta tag in the head area of the page
syntax normally is content="nofollow"
Unless there is a valid reason you should nofollow outgoing links from your site

3 - No Index
Using a noindex tag prevents a page from appearing in Google SERP's
This may appear to go against the reason for SEO existing in the first place but there are reasons it can be used
Google does not like duplicate content but if you have regional sites then there will be an issue. This is where using
noindex can benefit your site.
Noindex is a request and maybe ignored by the search spider
