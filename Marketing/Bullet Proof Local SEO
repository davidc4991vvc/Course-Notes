Prior to the individual sections there is an introduction video detailing a basic introduction to
the topics covered in the sections.


                     MODULE 1 - ON-PAGE FACTORS
There is an introduction video which covers an overview on the material which will be covered in more depth in each section
People using the course should be familiar with HTML tags
Local businesses will look to rank on keyword & city
Author recommends site structure of top level domain name -> category name -> product name
If possible have links to place where customers can offer reviews which will improve rankings
N.A.P - Name Address Phone Number this is especially important for local businesses and should be on all pages
Ensure you have a least 1 map on the site
Try to have some authority links eg Business Bureaus

1.1 - Google Webmaster Tools
This section focuses on backend specifically in WordPress
Google webmaster tools - Now known as Google webmaster tools
A quick run through how to add your site to Google Search Console
Schema.org or structured data - a shorthand for Google Bot to understand what certain elements of your site are about. 
There are many ways to implement this on your site, by hand if you know the code, plug-ins can be used and tools. However ranking a 
local client especially having the correct type of schema data is very, very important and is a must do because once Google Bot gets 
to that page and then sees that schema data, it has a lot more trust with what that site says that it's about and it can match things up 
much more quickly.
If Google sees something as an issue and it's something that it keeps track of, then it is something that matters. Google did not
pack this dashboard with stuff that does not matter to them. It's things that matter to them so it should matter to you.
