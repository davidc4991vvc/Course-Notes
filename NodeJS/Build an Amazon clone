Section 1 Overview
In this section there is an overview of the project, the tools and also the
technologies that will be used in building the project. There is also a very
brief run through of the HTTP protocol as this will be very important to understand
during the course.

Section 2 User Authentication
This is the first main section of the course and the first task is to install
Nodemon which is a tool which monitors your node project for any changes and automatically
restarts the server to save having to stop and start manually each time.
