          These are my notes from the React and Ruby On Rails course from Reilly.

Section 1 -
0101 - Introduction to the course and a demo of the working application, also a high level
explanation of the architecture involved in the application and how the different components
involved fit together. There is alos a brief explanation of the technologies that are going
to be used.

0102 - Making the initial application skeleton using rails new to create a new app. There are
a few ways of running rails most use rails s to start a server and ctrl-c to shut it down. Also
the gem file is changed to remove unnecessary gems and add in new ones such as rails admin. A 
rails migration using rails g migration is used to create a table this will need to be migrated
using rake:db migrate
