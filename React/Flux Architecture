          Learn Facebook Flux Architecture - Udemy Course Notes
            App is located at https://github.com/marb61a/reactbusiness

Section 1 -            
The first section of the course is a very brief introduction to both React and also Flux. There is also
a video on preparing the environment should you wish to follow along with the examples (Highly Recommended).

Section 2 -
This section is where the dive into React begins. The first video of the section is a intro to JSX (javascript extensions).
The syntax is very similar to XML and HTML with some differences. These include
          className must be used instead of class in an attribute
          htmlFor must be used instead of for in an attribute
This is because these words are reserved in Javascript and using them will create issues. The following is the code used

<html>
<head>
	<title>React & JSX</title>
<script src="https://fb.me/react-0.14.0.js"></script>
<script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.0.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.25/browser.js"></script>
<style>
	.green{color: green;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="container"></div>
	<script type="text/babel">
		var MyComponent = React.createClass({
			render: function(){
				return(
						<div>
							<h1 className="green">Welcome!</h1>
							<p>This is my React component</p>
						</div>
					);
			}
		});

		ReactDOM.render(
				<MyComponent />,
				document.getElementById('container')
			);
	</script>
</body>
</html>

As can be seen there is some difference between vanilla Javascript and React but the code is fairly self explanatory.
BabelJs is a Javascript compiler which supports amonmg many other things React and JSX.
