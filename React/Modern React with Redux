                              Notes from Udemy course by Stephen Grider
                              Modern React with Redux
                              
Section 1 - Intro to React
1 - The course starts off with an intro and links to prebuilt Github examples

2 - These are links to completed projects source code for comparison

3 - The instructor explains the rationale behind using boilerplate skeleton projects to facilitate learning
    React\Redux. Also explained is the structure of the boilerplate apps and the files and libraries that
    they use. ES6\2016 is used and it is also explained that at this stage not all browsers will support
    the use of this version of Javascript. The work around is to use tooling called transpiling using a set
    of tools called Babel & Webpack which will make a file compatable with browsers.
    
4 - This lecture is about how to setup the environment using the instructors premade git repository, upon
    cloning or copying the repository npm install will need to be run in order to install the dependencies
    that are needed.
    
5 - This video is about the project setup which is a video player built using React, there is a mockup used to
    explain how the video player will function, also there is no dummy data used instead the Youtube API is going
    to be used and the player itself is able to be deployed. The command npm start is used which will in turn create
    a local sever as well as running Webpack.
    
    ** Running a cloud based IDE like cloud9 will have different methods of running webpack server, you may also
    need to install dependencies using the -g for global and --save flags to ensure that you do not have to keep
    changing into directories. On cloud9 the following command works
    webpack-dev-server --port $PORT --host $IP  --content-base build/
