must be present. The Java Development Kit (JDK) has the JRE and other things that
are necessary to build software using the Java Programming Language.

There are several different Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools available.
These are complete applications which accelerate the speed of software development
by having a range of tools built in to one application. There are several available for
learning, this course uses IntelliJ which is a paid for IDE but is becoming the standard
IDE. Others include Eclipse, Netbeans, JBuilder and a plain Notepad will also do but will
not offer the same experience as using an IDE.
