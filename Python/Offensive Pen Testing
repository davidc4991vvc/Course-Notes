4 - TCP Reverse Shell Outline
The best definition of a reverse shell is this
A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine. 
The attacking machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection, which by using, code or command 
execution is achieved.
A TCP reverse shell is therefore a reverse shell using a TCP port

  Define a connection
  Start a socket object 
  Connect defining an attacker port and IP address
  Receive commands, if this is terminate then close connection
  If command received is not terminate then pass command to shell process
  Send back result or if appropriate an error
