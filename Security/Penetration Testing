                    Section 1 - Logistics of Pen Testing
For a full definition of what a Penetration Test is check this link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_testing
A penetration test is properly defined as a method of evaluating the vulnerabilities of a computer system or
network by simulating a malicious attack using current exploits, through various means including Social Engineering,
or physical attacks.
The basic process of a Pen Test involves a diligent analysis or Reconnaisance of the target system for any weaknesses,
technical flaws or vulnerabilities.
