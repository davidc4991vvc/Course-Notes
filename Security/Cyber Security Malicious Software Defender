                    Section 1: CSMD - Windows Binaries
1 - Building Executables
An introduction to the course author and the agenda
Windows Build Process
  - 1 Compiler Overview
      * Object files are generated by the compiler, each has its own functionality
      * Symbol Table is a table created by the compiler which stores information such as function names, variable names, types etc
  - 2 Linking
      2 types of linking, Static and Dynamic
      Static commonly has file extension lib, files are all included in the same binary, it is more portable.
      Dynamic commonly has the extension dll and is much more common in modern systems

2 - Executable Formats Part 1
A discussion on the windows executable format
  First part is always DOS MZ header and always starts with 0x4D 0x5D, 64 Bytes
