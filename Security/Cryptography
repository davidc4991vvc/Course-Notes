                      Notes from Cousera Cryptography Course
                      Via Stanford University
                      
                    Section 1 Introduction
1 - Course Overview
Instructor introduces himself and some of the expectations of the material that the course will cover.
There are also some recommendatons made as how to approach the course as the experience will be different
than would be the case if it were an in person course.
There is a quick discussion on how and where cryptography is used and some of the applications that it is used in.
