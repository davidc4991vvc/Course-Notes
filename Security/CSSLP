Part 2 – Tenets of Secure Architecture and Design
 How Much Security is enough?  
- Defense in Depth

- Fail-safe

- Economy of Mechanism (The K.I.S.S principle)
  KISS the acronym stands for Keep It Simple Stupid.
  It is used is widely diverse areas of I.T.
  
- Completeness of Design

- Least Common Mechanism

- Open Design

- Consider the Weakest Link

- Redundancy

- Psychological Acceptability
- Separation of Duties (SOD)
- Mandatory Vacations
- Job rotation
- Least privilege
- Need to know
- Dual control


Part 3 – Trusted Computing Requirements of System Architecture
- An information system’s architecture must satisfy the defined business and security requirements.

- Security should be built into an information system by design.

- When designing system architecture, security and business requirements needs to be carefully balanced. 

- Tradeoffs are involved in reaching a balance between security and business requirements.


Part 4 – Security Models and Access Control Models
- The security requirements of any information system will be driven by the security policy of the organization that will
use the security model. It lays out the framework and mathematical models that act as security-related specifications for a 
system architecture.
- The system architecture, in turn, is the overall design of the components - such as hardware, operating systems, applications, 
and networks – of an information system. This design should meet the specifications provided by the security model.

TCB (Trusted Computer Base)
- Originated from the Orange Book and deals with the protection mechanisms within a computer. It addresses hardware, software, and 
firmware. 
 - Security Perimeter, It delineates the trusted and the untrusted components within a computer system. 
 - Reference Monitor, The reference monitor is an abstract machine concept that mediates all access between subjects and objects.
 - Security Kernel, The Security kernel enforces the reference monitor concept. 
                    Must facilitate isolation of processes 
                    Must be invoked at every access attempt.
                    Must be small enough to be tested and verified in a comprehensive manner
                    

Security Models -
 - Bell-LaPadula 
    - Has 3 rules: 
      - Simple Security Property – “no read up” 
        - A subject cannot read data from a security level higher than subject’s security level. 
      - *_Security Property – “no write down” 
        - A subject cannot write data to a security level lower than the subject’s security level. 
      - Strong * Property – “no read/write up or down”. 
        - A subject with read/write privilege can perform read/write functions only  at the subject’s security levels.
        
 - Biba
  - Simple integrity axiom – “no read down” 
    – A Subject cannot read data from an object of lower integrity level.
  * Integrity axiom – “no write up”
    – A Subject cannot write data to an object at a higher integrity level.
  Invocation property 
    – A subject cannot invoke (call upon) subjects at a higher integrity level.
    
 - Clark-Wilson
 - Integrity models
  – Clark-Wilson Model 
    - Model Characteristics: 
      - Clark Wilson enforces well-formed transactions through the use of the access triple:
      - UserTransformation ProcedureCDI (Constrained Data Item) 
    - SEPARATION of DUTIES
      - Deals with all three integrity goals 
        - Prevents unauthorized users from making modifications
        - Prevents authorized users from making improper modifications
        - Maintain internal and external consistency – reinforces separation of duties
        
 - Brewer-Nash
 
 - Take-Grant 


Part 5 – Adversaries and Review
- Script Kiddies - The wikipedia definition of a Script Kiddie is is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs 
developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites. It is generally assumed that script kiddies 
are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try 
to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities.However, the term does not relate to the actual age 
of the participant. The term is generally considered to be pejorative.
*** In penetration testing use of prewritten tools is a necessity but what differentiates people using these tools from Script
Kiddies is that the former are able to extend and change scrips etc both when and to what operating circumstances dictate.

- Hackers 

- Elite - Also referred to as leet or 1337, this was used to prevent search indexing of sites used by hackers. It originates
from Cult of The Dead Cow 31337 or eleet. Elite hackers have advanced skills covering many different areas included advanced 
techniques such as reverse engineering

- Non-Structured

- Structured

- Highly Structured


- Nation State
Nation state hackers are involved in Cyber-War and hack for political rather than financial or technical means.
The hacking techniques that are used are extremely adavanced and may not be feasible for smaller groups.
There is a whole military style language used to describe these hacks, there is an article describing this language at

- Who’s the Target

These are then followed by a review of the. material in the preceeding sections.

Part 6 – Risk Intro
RISK RELATED DEFINITIONS
- Risk:  Likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability in an asset 
- Threat:  Has the potential to harm an asset
- Vulnerability:  A weakness;  a lack of a safeguard
- Exploit:  Instance of compromise
- Controls:  Protective mechanisms to secure vulnerabilities
- Safeguards:  Proactive
- Countermeasures: Reactive mechanism
- Secondary Risk:  Risk event that comes as a result of another risk response
- Residual Risk:  The amount of risk left over after a risk response
- Fallback Plan:  “Plan B”
- Workaround:  Unplanned Response (for unidentified risk or when other responses don’t work


Part 7 – Risk Assessment
- Identify and Valuate Assets
- Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities
- Methodologies
                - OCTAVE:  an approach where analysts identify asses and their criticality, 
                identify vulnerabilities and threats and base the protection strategy to reduce risk
                - FRAP:  Facilitated Risk Analysis Process.  Qualitative analysis used to determine whether or not to proceed 
                with a quantitative analysis.  If likelihood or impact is too low, the quantiative analysis if foregone.
                - NIST 800-30:  Risk management Guide for Information Technology systems. NIST has a 9 step process -
                  - System characterization
                  - Threat identification
                  - Vulnerability identification
                  - Control analysis
                  - Likelihood Determination
                  - Impact Analysis
                  - Risk Determination
                  - Control Recommendations
                  - Results Documentation


Part 8 – Risk Analysis
There are 2 main types - 
Qualitative 
- Subjective analysis to help prioritize probability and impact of risk events.  
- May use Delphi Technique 
Quantitative  
- Providing a dollar value to a particular risk event.  
- Much more sophisticated in nature, a quantitative analysis if much more difficult and requires a special skill set 
- Business decisions are made on a quantitative analysis

Neither on of these can exist on its own for instance Quantitative analysis depends on qualitative information

Mindset for the CSSLP
- The Exam is not about the code, it is about the process of writing the code. 
- The better the process, the better the product. 
- Do NOT fix Problems.  Fix the process. 
- How much security is enough? 
- All decisions start with risk management.  Risk management starts with Identifying/Valuating your assets.
