Mindset for the CSSLP
- The Exam is not about the code, it is about the process of writing the code. 
- The better the process, the better the product. 
- Do NOT fix Problems.  Fix the process. 
- How much security is enough? 
- All decisions start with risk management.  Risk management starts with Identifying/Valuating your assets. 
- Incorporate security into the design, as opposed to adding it on later 
- Layered Defense!
