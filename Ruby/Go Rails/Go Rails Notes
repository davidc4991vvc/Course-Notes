                    Notes from GoRails Screencasts
                    
1 - Environment Variables
Environment variables are variables created by an OS that can be used by different applications
Some include
  - $PATH - this shows paths to files
  - $EMAIL_ADDRESS - shows user email address
There are multiple different environment variables available
ruby -v shows ruby version
By setting a key and then using the irb shell with ENV["key"] will show the kay value
Storing passwords and keys in environment variables is used in a lot of ruby apps rather than in the application
Using the export command sets the variable for the session
.bashrc is the file on linux for setting environment variables that last


2 - Ruby Version Managers
Multiple ways to setup and install Ruby
RVM - Ruby Version Manager, full feature version manager
RBEnv - Lightweight ruby version manager (for more advanced users)


3 - Rails Application Structure
rails new "app name" will create a new file
ru - Rackup file, rack is a tool to run a webserver
