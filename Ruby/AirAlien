                                Project based course
                                
Section 1 -
The first section covers the basics of installation of ruby, rails etc. I use Cloud9 and Nitrous
cloud based IDE's to avoid issues with local installations as I run multiple OS. Also is the generation
of a new ruby app - rails new. Then the bootstrap sass gem is installed and set up.

Section 2 -
In the first part of section we install devise which is used for user authentication in rails,
we begin by adding the devise gem to the gem file. Then
bundle install  - Gets the gem in question and adds it to the system
rails g devise:install - Installs devise to the application
rails g devise User - Generates a user
rake db:migrate - Migrates the tables that have been created
rails g devise:views - This creates a set of devise views for the application

There are a couple of other steps, the first is that the folling has to be added to the development config file
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
then the following must be added to the application layout file
<p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
<p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
This completes the first video of the section.

In the next video of the section we tackle installing the navbar which works with Bootstrap. By default the navbar
is white but can be set to black by using inverse. It can also be colored using settings in the stylesheets. The
rails g controller Pages home
command is used to create both a pages controller and also related views.
In order to avoid constantly retyping code the navabar is put into a seperate file and all components can be put here to
be reused. The rails convention is to call these files partials and they are denoted by a leading underscore eg 
_navbar.html. The appliaction must also be made aware of the partials existence and this is done by puttin a render
commend followed by the file path, if this is not done then there will be errors as rails will not know where to find
the navbar.
