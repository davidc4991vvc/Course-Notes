                                Project based course
                                
Section 1 -
The first section covers the basics of installation of ruby, rails etc. I use Cloud9 and Nitrous
cloud based IDE's to avoid issues with local installations as I run multiple OS. Also is the generation
of a new ruby app - rails new. Then the bootstrap sass gem is installed and set up.

Section 2 -
In the first part of section we install devise which is used for user authentication in rails,
we begin by adding the devise gem to the gem file. Then
bundle install  - Gets the gem in question and adds it to the system
rails g devise:install - Installs devise to the application
rails g devise User - Generates a user
rake db:migrate - Migrates the tables that have been created
rails g devise:views - This creates a set of devise views for the application

There are a couple of other steps, the first is that the folling has to be added to the development config file
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
then the following must be added to the application layout file
<p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
<p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
This completes the first video of the section.
