                    Section 1 Define
1 - The Basics of Six Sigma(First Part)
Six Sigma Definition - A business improvement approach that seeks to find and then eliminate causes of both mistakes
and defects in business processes by focusing on those outputs that are of critical importance to a customer.
Normal distributed processes - over 99% fall within +\- 3.0 sigma where Sigma is a statistical term that, refers to the 
standard deviation of a process about it’s mean.
Motorola developed six sigma as a key business initiative in 1987 as a result of Bill Smith’s yield theory. 
Motorola noted that many operations, such as complex assemblies, tended to shift 1.5 sigma over time. This means that  a
process, with a normal distribution and normal variation of the mean, would need to have specification limits of
+\-6 sigma in order to produce less than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. This failure rate can be referred to as
defects per opportunity (DPO), or defects per million opportunities (DPMO).
To reach the 6 sigma level, a process would have only 3.4 Defects per Million Opportunities. This illustrates the very
core principle of Six Sigma which is to is to deliver near perfect products and services by improving the process
and eliminating defects

Most oganisations use the acronym DMAIC to illustrate the steps in the process
- Define: Select the appropriate responses (the “Ys”) to be improved.
- Measure: Data must be gathered to measure the response variable.
- Analyze: Identify the root causes of defects or significant measurement deviations whether in or out of specifications.
- Improve: Reduce variability or eliminate the cause.
- Control: With the desired improvements in place, monitor the process to sustain improvements
The above are applied to all projects

Dr Mikel Harry takes these steps a bit further with 8 steps with his RDMAICSI approach
- R Recognize the true states of your business.
- D Define what plans must be in place to realize improvement of each state.
- M Measure the business systems that support the plans.
- A Analyze the gaps in system performance benchmarks.
- l Improve system elements to achieve performance goals.
- C Control system-level characteristics those are critical to value.
- S Standardize the systems that prove to be best-in-class.
- l Integrate best-in-class systems into the strategic planning framework.

Six Sigma utilises a number of different tools such as lean manufacturing, DOE (design of experiments), and DFSS (design 
for six sigma) and even uses some TQM(Total Quality Management).
Business can enjoy great success from using Six Sigma including -
- Cost reductions: Reduction of cost is critical for running a company successfully.
- Productivity improvements: Productivity improvement implies maximizing performance of resources.
- Customer relations improvements: If customers are unhappy the organisation has problems.
- Defect reductions: Defects result in reworking and each reworked transaction is an additional cost.
- Product and service improvements: Products\Services need to change with time to reflect any changes in the world. 
- Cycle-Time reductions: Processing time from order to cash must be minimised so cycle-time reduction is a critical aspect.

Understand the reasons why Six Sigma works is important so here are some reasons
- Bottom line results
- Senior management is involved
- A disciplined approach is used (DMAIC\RDMAICSI)
- Short project completion times (3 to 6 months)
- Clearly defined measures of success
- Infrastructure of trained individuals (black belts, green belts)
- Customers and processes are the focus
- A sound statistical approach is used
Some organisations have found that they can even go beyond Six Sigma often this occurs because defects become rare and
are given proper attention thus improving the process even further.
